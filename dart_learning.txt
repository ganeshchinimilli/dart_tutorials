OOps
Class --- classess are defined  blueprint of associated objects.
to get the properties of the clss we need the object.--it is a user defined class which declares the characterist and behaviour of it
class className{
    >fields>
    <getters/setters>
    <constructorS>
    <functions>
}

Object --Object is a real life entity of the table.hunman.it has 2 charactreistsic.state and behaviour

var object  = new ClassNAme(constructor arguments)

inheritance -- used to create a new class from the existing classes .The CLass that to be extendded is called as 
parent /super class
class child_class extends Parent_Class

polymorphism --where one thing has many forms. 2 types --run time polymorphism,or compiler polymorphism
example as function has same name but different functionality or class
another was shape() which was inherited from rectange,circle,and triangle

interferences - -these also blueprint of the class.We can declare methods and variables inside the interface just like the class but in interface only abstract declaration of methods is provided.

abstract class --A class that contains more than abstract method is called abstract class


Constrcutor has teh same name as the class -
class ClassName{
    ClassName(){
        
    }
}
default contructor no arguments
parameter constructor
named constructor
